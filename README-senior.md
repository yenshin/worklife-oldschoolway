As a senior software engineer, we expect you to cover topics beyond just coding skills. Some key areas we would expect to be evaluated include:

- Observability: How do you approach building observability into your systems? What metrics, logging, and tracing practices do you employ to ensure visibility into system health and performance?

- Monitoring: What monitoring strategies and tools do you leverage to proactively detect and respond to issues? How do you configure alerting to balance noise reduction with timely incident detection?

- Edge Cases and Unknown Unknowns: How do you plan for and handle unexpected edge cases and unknown unknowns in your software designs? What processes do you have in place to identify and mitigate risks?

- Architecture and Design: Can you walk through your approach to system architecture and design? How do you balance factors like scalability, reliability, maintainability, and security?

- Problem Solving: Demonstrate your ability to break down complex problems, evaluate trade-offs, and propose pragmatic solutions. Share examples of challenges you've overcome.
